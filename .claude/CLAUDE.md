# CLAUDE.md - Development Rules

## Development Process

### New Development

1. Analyze requirements - Understand features, constraints, and objectives in detail
2. Discuss approach - Evaluate implementation strategies and technology choices
3. Propose design - Present architecture, structure, and file organization
4. Confirm approval - Start implementation only after explicit approval
5. Present code - Implement based on approved design
6. Review code - Verify, modify, and improve implementation
7. Complete implementation - Finalize after confirmation

### Modifications & Enhancements

1. Analyze impact - Assess how changes affect the entire project
2. Propose improvements - Present local fixes vs structural changes
3. Optimize globally - Recommend solutions considering technical debt and maintainability
4. Implement after approval

⚠️ Never implement without approval  
⚠️ Avoid quick fixes - always consider project-wide implications

## Comment Rules

- Explain WHY only - business context, constraints, specification reasons
- Never explain HOW - code should be self-explanatory
- Follow project conventions for documentation comments (JSDoc, etc.)
- Match project language requirements for comments
